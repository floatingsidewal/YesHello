# YesHello 👋

> A focus on empathy, first impressions, and not being a douche.

## What is this?

**YesHello** is a playful counterpoint to the [NoHello movement](https://nohello.net/). While NoHello teaches us not to waste time with empty "hello" messages in async communication, YesHello reminds us that *sometimes hello IS the point*.

This is for those moments when:
- Your status says "Available" and you mean it
- You want coworkers to feel comfortable just... being human
- You believe efficiency and empathy aren't mutually exclusive
- You're tired of treating every conversation like a support ticket

**TL;DR:** If I'm available, feel free to say hi. No agenda required. You're a person, not an API endpoint.

## The Philosophy 💭

YesHello isn't about rejecting NoHello—it's about balance. Here's what we believe:

- **Life's too short** to only talk when there's a P0 incident
- **Your coworkers are not API endpoints**—they're humans who sometimes need connection
- **Sometimes "how was your weekend?"** is more valuable than "quick question"
- **A 30-second "hey, how are you?"** can prevent a 3-hour misunderstanding later
- **Efficiency is great,** but efficiency without empathy is just being a robot
- **Not every interaction needs ROI**—some things are just... nice
- **The best teams** aren't the ones that only talk about work
- **Mental health matters** more than shaving 30 seconds off a Slack thread
- **If someone feels comfortable saying hi,** they'll feel comfortable asking for help when it matters
- **You can respect someone's time** AND treat them warmly—they're not mutually exclusive

## When YesHello Applies 🎯

### Status Guide

- **🟢 Available:** Just vibing, say hi! No agenda required. Want to chat about your weekend? Go for it. Random thoughts? I'm here for it.
- **🟡 Busy:** I'm in the zone, but I won't bite. Quick hellos are fine. Long chats might need to wait, but you're not interrupting anything life-or-death.
- **🔴 Offline:** I'm probably touching grass, sleeping, or finally watching that show everyone won't shut up about. Leave a message!

### Practical Scenarios

**You want to ask a question but worry it's "dumb"**
→ Just ask. Lead with "quick question" or "hey!" if you want. I promise you're not bothering me.

**You're having a rough day and need to vent**
→ "Hey, got a minute?" is totally fine. You don't need to write a formal problem statement.

**You saw something funny and want to share**
→ Share it! Laughter is underrated in remote work. Start with "lol check this out" if you want.

**Monday morning and you're just checking in**
→ "Morning! How was your weekend?" is perfectly valid and actually helps team morale.

**You're new and feeling overwhelmed**
→ Say so! "Hi, I'm struggling with X" is exactly what you should send. We all started somewhere.

**You just want to say thanks for something**
→ Do it! "Hey, thanks for your help earlier!" makes people's day. Gratitude is never wasted.

## NoHello vs YesHello 🤝

| NoHello ❌ | YesHello ✅ |
|------------|-------------|
| "Don't waste time with 'hello'—get to the point!" | "Hello IS the point sometimes. You're not a ticket system." |
| "Every message should have a purpose." | "Building rapport IS a purpose. Connection counts." |
| "Async communication means never waiting for responses." | "Sometimes a 2-minute chat beats a 2-hour email thread." |
| "Maximize productivity at all costs." | "Maximize humanity. Productivity follows." |
| "I'm too busy for small talk." | "I'm never too busy to treat you like a person." |
| "Everyone's time is equally scarce." | "Sometimes people just need to feel seen." |

## The Bottom Line 🎬

**NoHello is right** when you're in heads-down mode, working across timezones, or dealing with truly urgent matters. Be respectful of people's time and attention.

**But YesHello is the reminder** that work is also about relationships, trust, and being human together. If someone's status says "Available," they're giving you permission to just... be you.

**So yes, hello.** How are you doing? 💚
